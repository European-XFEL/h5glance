**H5Glance** lets you explore HDF5 files in an HTML interface.

In particular, you can easily inspect HDF5 files in a Jupyter Notebook.
`Demo.ipynb <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/takluyver/h5glance/blob/master/Demo.ipynb>`_
shows how to use it.

There is also a command line interface, through the command ``h5glance``.
